Accountability lives in the WHAT and WHEN.

FORMULA:
1. Validate (acknowledge the person's concern or feeling)
2. State constraint (clarify what you're accountable for)
3. Offer choice (preserve their autonomy in how they work)
4. Lock next step (agree on concrete checkpoint)

TOPIC: {topic}

Your task is to:
1. Expand on the core principle with 2-3 concrete examples related to the topic
2. Show how the formula applies in practice
3. Highlight common mistakes to avoid
