CRITICAL: FIX YOUR OPENAI_API_KEY IN RENDER

1. GO TO RENDER DASHBOARD
   - Visit: https://dashboard.render.com
   - Select your service: "difficult-conversations-training"

2. FIX THE API KEY (Most Important!)
   - Click "Environment" tab
   - Find OPENAI_API_KEY
   - Click Edit
   
   MAKE SURE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS:
   ✓ sk-proj-abc123def456...
   
   NOT LIKE THIS:
   ✗ "sk-proj-abc123def456..."  (has quotes)
   ✗ Your actual OpenAI API key  (placeholder text)
   
   - If wrong, paste your REAL OpenAI key (no quotes, no spaces)
   - Click Save

3. FORCE REDEPLOY
   - Click "Manual Deploy" tab
   - Click "Clear build cache & deploy"
   - Wait 5-10 minutes

4. CHECK LOGS
   - Click "Logs" tab
   - Look for:
   
   SUCCESS - You'll see:
   ===========================================================
   GUNICORN STARTING - Environment Check:
     OPENAI_API_KEY: SET
     OPENAI_API_KEY length: 164
     OPENAI_API_KEY prefix: sk-proj-...
   ===========================================================
   [STARTUP] OPENAI_API_KEY present: True
   
   FAILURE - You'll see:
   OPENAI_API_KEY: NOT SET
   [ERROR] OPENAI_API_KEY is not set!

5. IF IT WORKS
   - Your app will be live at: https://your-service-name.onrender.com
   - Test it by clicking "Start Module"

6. IF IT STILL FAILS
   - Copy the entire log output
   - The logs will show exactly what's wrong
   - Share the logs for more help

===============================================================================
GET YOUR OPENAI API KEY
===============================================================================

If you need a new OpenAI API key:

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign in to your OpenAI account
3. Click "+ Create new secret key"
4. Name it: "Difficult Conversations Training"
5. Click "Create secret key"
6. COPY THE KEY IMMEDIATELY (shown only once!)

===============================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
===============================================================================

ISSUE: "Error starting module: OpenAI API key is required"
FIX: Your OPENAI_API_KEY in Render is wrong or missing
     - Go to Environment tab in Render
     - Check the value (remove quotes if present)
     - Make sure it's your actual key from OpenAI

ISSUE: App shows 404 or doesn't load
FIX: Check Render logs for errors
     - The new debug logging will tell you exactly what's wrong

ISSUE: "Application failed to respond"
FIX: Wait longer (free tier takes 30-60 seconds to wake up)
     OR check if deployment completed successfully
